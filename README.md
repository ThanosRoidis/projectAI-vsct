# Visual Story Cloze Test
This is the repository for our "Project AI" submission of the spring 2017 semester at the UvAs AI master's course, in which we have to complete an AI-related project in a single month.

In this project we used the then-newly released [Visual Storytelling Dataset](https://visionandlanguage.net/VIST/) to predict the ending of a visual story given all the previous frames.

More specifically, given the first 4 images of the story we had to predict which one was the final 5th one from 5 choices by extracting features with a CNN and feeding them into an LSTM. You can see the final report [https://github.com/ThanosRoidis/projectAI-vsct/blob/master/Project%20AI%20-%20Visual%20Story%20Cloze%20Test%20(Report)_11426381_11413441_11400587.pdf](here)
